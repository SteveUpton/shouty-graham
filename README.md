=============

Basically just tweets everything a given Twitter user tweets, switches it to all caps and strips out the @s to avoid annoying people they mention. It's an extremely subtle way of hinting that someone is loud.

Can be deplyed to Heroku as is (provided environment variables are set up correctly) or run from any old ruby prompt if the keys are entered manually.
